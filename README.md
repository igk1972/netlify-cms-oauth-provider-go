## 2) Config

### Auth Provider Config

Configuration is done with environment variables, which can be supplied as command line arguments, added in your app  hosting interface, or loaded from a .env ([dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)) file.

**Example .env file:**

```
HOST=localhost:3000
CALLBACK_HOST=localhost:3000
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-string
GITHUB_KEY=
GITHUB_SECRET=
BITBUCKET_KEY=
BITBUCKET_SECRET=
GITLAB_KEY=
GITLAB_SECRET=
```

**Client ID & Client Secret:**
After registering your Oauth app, you will be able to get your client id and client secret on the next page.

### CMS Config
You also need to add `base_url` to the backend section of your netlify-cms's config file. `base_url` is the live URL of this repo with no trailing slashes.

```
backend:
  name: github
  repo: user/repo   # Path to your Github repository
  branch: master    # Branch to update
  base_url: https://your.server.com # Path to ext auth provider
```
